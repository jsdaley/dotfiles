# zsh/nudges.zsh — steer muscle memory toward the modern tools.
#
# Two kinds of nudges:
#   1. Retired tools (uninstalled): a function shadows the old name and points
#      you at the replacement instead of a bare "command not found".
#   2. Still-installed legacy tools we want to stop using: same idea, but you can
#      bypass with `command <name>` if you really need the original.
#
# (The day-to-day swaps — ls→eza, cat→bat, grep→rg, find→fd, du→dust, df→duf,
#  ps→procs, top→btop, cd→zoxide, dig→doggo — live in aliases.zsh / tools.zsh.)

# Some names below may already be aliases (egrep/fgrep ship as aliases on macOS,
# and others may come from omz). zsh can't define a function over an existing
# alias, so clear them first.
